# Email-Spam-Filter
This program was a project I completed in my second semester to predict whether an email is spam or not spam.
For the prediction method, I used the nearest neighbor method since that produced the most success, and for the distance calculation I used the euclidean distance formula. I also tried using the summary of the features to run the test against, but the accuracy was not as good. I narrowed down the following features: word frequency, n-gram frequency, url count, and special character word count, since those best determine whether and email is spam or not. The runtime for the test dataset with the nearest neighbor method is 45 min, and has 96.4169% accuracy. All of the datasets I used (spam_training.csv, ham_training.csv, and ham_and_spam_test.csv) are all in the project folder. All you have to do is run main. It will take 45 min, and will output each prediction to the console as it runs as well as print it to Predictions.csv
